# QuickTicket

Read [QUICK-TICKET.md](QUICK-TICKET.md) and apply it to the requested idea, task or project, using the conversation and relevant project context. Natural requests such as "Quickticket this project" invoke this workflow. Where supported, `$quickticket` is an optional explicit shortcut.

Use the agent's existing model, research tools and project conventions. No separate LogicTune installation is required. Keep inspection and ticket edits within the requested project and authorized destination. This skill plans and reconciles tickets; it does not authorize implementation, publication or changes to operating instructions, model settings or other agents.

Use the project's native status names and completion authority. The guide's "confirmed" means the equivalent completion state, not a new status or permission to bypass the project's verifier.
